## Finspark Hackathon Project
Our theme was Bridging the Language Gap in Indian Banking.
We built a multilingual financial literacy chatbot, aimed at making banking and financial knowledge more accessible across Indiaâ€™s diverse linguistic landscape especially for underserved, regional-language communities.
